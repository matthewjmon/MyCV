# CV Portfolio Website

An interactive CV portfolio website built during my full-stack bootcamp. It showcases my background, skills, education, and projects in a clean and responsive layout.

## Features
- Interactive and responsive design
- Visual presentation of personal and professional information
- Offline access via Service Worker
- Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript

This portfolio will be continually updated as I build more projects and gain further experience.
